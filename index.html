				<p>I have been programming ever since I was a freshman in high school. I had just beaten a video game I 
				was playing, and the credits displayed the Java programming language logo. I was curious, and after some 
				research, I ended the night writing my first "Hello World" program.
				<br /><br />After spending many years exclusively coding in Java, I decided to make the switch to the C 
				languages. I started off practicing C++ through making small ASCII video games. Soon after that, I found C# and have been coding in the .NET framework ever since.
				<br /><br />I am absolutely in love with rock climbing, surrealist art. You can always find me near a mountain, on my computer, or at an art museum. I'm constantly trying to find ways to incorporate artistic inspiration into 
				my projects.</p>
